## Lab05- TicTacToe ##

# This program is a simple TicTacToe game for the user to play the computer(random choice).
# You will create a n by n tic-tac-toe game where the user decides the size of the board.


# Create a n*n board with all empty spaces
def createBoard(n):
    return None # replace this line along with your code


# Asks the user for the row and column to place their move
def userInput():
    return None # replace this line along with your code


# Randomly selects a row and column to place the computer's move, has to be open slot
def computerChoose(board):
    return None # replace this line along with your code


# Checks if either player won(n in a row vertical, horizontal, or diagonal)
def checkWin(board):
    return None # replace this line along with your code


# Checks if draw(board is full)
def isBoardFull(board):
    return None # replace this line along with your code


# Prints the board
def printBoard(board):
    return None # replace this line along with your code


# Wrapper function(prints board after each turn, lets user repeatedly play after game ends, keeps track of score)
# You should ask user input if they would like to continue playing after each game
# If the user inputs "quit" at any point, the program should stop
def main():
    return None # replace this line along with your code
